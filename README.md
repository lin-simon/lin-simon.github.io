Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This site was built purely using HTML and CSS to showcase my frontend web development skills and my various coding projects.

# HTML
I used HTML to structure the content of my website and create the various pages. I incorporated semantic HTML tags, such as header, footer, and article, to clearly define the purpose of each section of the page.

# CSS
I used CSS to style the website and make it visually appealing with animations. I experimented with different layout and design techniques, including flexbox and grid, to create a responsive and user-friendly experience.

# Bootstrap
To achieve a responsive design, I utilized Bootstrap, a popular CSS framework. Bootstrap provides a collection of pre-built CSS classes and JavaScript components that helped me rapidly develop and customize the layout and responsiveness of my website. By utilizing Bootstrap's grid system, responsive utilities, and ready-made components, I was able to ensure that my website looks great on various screen sizes and devices.

# Projects
On my portfolio, you will find a selection of projects that demonstrate my skills in programming. Each project includes a brief description and a link to view the repository on GitHub.

# Contact
I am open to work and always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow as a developer. If you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project, please feel free to contact me through the listed contacts on my website or on LinkedIn @ https://www.linkedin.com/in/lin-simon.
